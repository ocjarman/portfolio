# Olivia's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Olivia, a frontend engineer, mom, runner, proud owner of a feisty 3 lb chihuahua, and coffee lover. This is where I showcase my work and share a bit about my journey in tech.

## About Me

I'm a frontend engineer who transitioned from education into tech. I'm passionate about building user experiences that are both beautiful and functional. When I'm not coding, I'm usually running, wrangling two young kids, or enjoying a good cup of cold brew.

## What You'll Find Here

- A showcase of my projects and work
- My professional journey and experience
- A glimpse into what matters to me (family, running, healthy living & getting outdoors whenever possible - even in the Florida heat!)
- A way to connect and get in touch

Feel free to explore and reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!
